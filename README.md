For the chosen task of creating a simple voting system in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI), I applied a range of skills that demonstrated my proficiency in both software development and user interface design.

The project required the development of a voting application where students could input their admission number and vote for one of 15 available options, each represented by a button. I chose Python's `Tkinter` library for the GUI, as it is well-suited for creating simple and effective interfaces.

First, I structured the code by designing a class-based system to encapsulate the voting logic, ensuring a modular and organized codebase. The GUI elements were carefully arranged using `Tkinter` widgets like `Label`, `Entry`, and `Button`. I implemented a grid layout for the voting buttons, arranging them horizontally with 5 buttons per row, ensuring a neat and user-friendly interface.

Error handling was a key focus. I added checks to ensure users input their admission number before voting and prevented multiple votes from the same user. The voting data was stored in a dictionary, mapping each admission number to the chosen vote. This approach allowed for efficient storage and retrieval of voting information.

Additionally, I incorporated a feature to display the voting results in a separate window, providing users with immediate feedback on the voting outcome. The application was made more robust by including pop-up messages for user interaction and error notifications using `messagebox`.

This project showcased my ability to blend programming logic with UI design, ensuring that the application was not only functional but also intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. By applying these skills, I successfully created a voting system that is both effective and user-friendly.
